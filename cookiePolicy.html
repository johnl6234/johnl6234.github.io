    <h4>3. About cookies</h4>
    <p>
      3.1 A cookie is a file containing an identifier (a string of letters and
      numbers) that is sent by a web server to a web browser and is stored by
      the browser. The identifier is then sent back to the server each time the
      browser requests a page from the server.
    </p>
    <p>
      3.2 Cookies may be either "persistent" cookies or "session" cookies: a
      persistent cookie will be stored by a web browser and will remain valid
      until its set expiry date, unless deleted by the user before the expiry
      date; a session cookie, on the other hand, will expire at the end of the
      user session, when the web browser is closed.
    </p>
    <p>
      3.3 Cookies may not contain any information that personally identifies a
      user, but personal data that we store about you may be linked to the
